# Using the YAML block scalar `|` allows for multi-line strings.
description: |
  This query identifies DNS requests to domains listed in the AI-Domains.csv lookup. It filters out browser-initiated traffic from Chrome and Edge. The result highlights which hosts and processes are generating the most DNS requests to those domains.

explanation: |
  The query relies on an lookup file with at least one column named Domain. The lookup provides the set of AI-related domains to check against. Without this file, the match() operator cannot resolve which DNS requests should be considered relevant.
