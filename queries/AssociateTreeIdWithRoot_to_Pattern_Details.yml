  The query filters for AssociateTreeIdWithRoot events, joins them with detection-pattern metadata 
  from a CSV file, and outputs key fields like timestamp, host, pattern details 
  and severity for analysis. In short, it enriches process-tree association events
  with contextual detection information.

  ## [AssociateTreeIdWithRoot](https://docs.crowdstrike.com/r/associatetreeidwithroot)
  This event is generated when there is a detection in the sensor. This event has a data field called PatternId that contains a pattern ID. Pattern IDs correspond to a detection.
