## How to Contribute

We welcome pull requests with new queries or improvements to existing ones.  
Hereâ€™s the process:

1. **Explore existing queries**  
   - Browse the repo to check if your query (or a similar one) already exists.  
   - If it does, consider enhancing it instead of duplicating.  

2. **Create your query in the right format**  
   - Use our online **[CQL Hub YAML Builder](https://cql-hub.com)** to easily create a new `.yml` file in the correct format.  
   - This ensures consistency across all queries in the repository.  

3. **Add your query to the repo**  
   - Fork this repository.  
   - Add your new `.yml` file under the appropriate directory.  
   - Make sure the file name is descriptive and aligned with the use case.  

4. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   - Open a PR with your changes.  
   - Provide a short description of the query, including:  
     - The purpose of the query (e.g., detection of suspicious PowerShell activity).  
     - Related MITRE ATT&CK techniques, if applicable.  
     - Any limitations or known caveats.

## Guidelines for Queries
- **Clarity**: Keep queries well-documented and include comments where necessary.  
- **Consistency**: Use the YAML structure from the **CQL Hub builder**.  
- **Quality**: Queries should be tested before submission to avoid false positives or broken logic.  
- **Attribution**: Add yourself as the author in the YAML metadata so contributors get credit.
